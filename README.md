# social-gatherer
social-gatherer is a wrapper for popular social media apps. It introduces new methods to listen to events that happen in them.

Right now, it only has events for when you post... I'll add more when I have time.

## Important
Work in Progress!
I should add a no-API option..

## Installation
Requirements: `node, git` and some amount of patience. (my dumbass doesnt know how to publish an npm module)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DoormatIka/social-gatherer
cd social-gatherer
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage
Get every file in `src/js` and copy-paste them to wherever in your project.
Go to the Wiki Page.
